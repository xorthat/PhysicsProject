This directory contains:

- This README.txt file.
- The file ImageOwners.txt describing the images owners.
- The file Calibration.txt providing camera calibration for all images.
- The matlab file displayall.m allows to display the database.
- 18 files named Dmap-0000??.fdd which contains a floating point array of the depthmap. 
  These images can be used as ground-truth for shape from fog algorithms. 
- 18 png images named LIma-0000??.png of a scene without fog. These images can be used 
  as ground-truth for evaluation of visibility and contrast restoration algorithms.
- 18 png images named U080-0000??.png of a scene with homogeneous fog. 
- 18 png images named K080-0000??.png of a scene with heterogeneous fog. 
- 18 png images named L080-0000??.png of a scene with cloudy homogeneous fog. 
- 18 png images named M080-0000??.png of a scene with cloudy heterogeneous fog.
