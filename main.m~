%This is based upon the paper: Detecting Foggy Images and Estimating the Haze Degree Factor

%I(x) = J(x)t(x) + A(1 - t(x))
%x: pixel location
%J(x): haze-free image
%I(x): observed hazy image
%A: global atmosphere light
%t(x): medium transmission
    %When the atmosphere is homogeneous t(x)=exp(?? · dep(x))
    %? is is the scattering coor
